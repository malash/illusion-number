## Usage

Use `bower`  to install `illusion-number` to your project:

```bash
$ bower install illusion-number
```

Then include `.js` and `.css` files:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/beep/bower_components/illusion-number/dist/illusion-number.min.css">
<script src="/beep/bower_components/illusion-number/dist/illusion-number.min.js"></script>
```

Put an empty `div` emelent to your HTML file:

```html
<div id="test"></div>
```

Call global variable `IllusionNumber`'s method `play` with the element and options:

```javascript
IllusionNumber.play(document.getElementById('test'), {
  from: '0',
  to: '1'
});
```
